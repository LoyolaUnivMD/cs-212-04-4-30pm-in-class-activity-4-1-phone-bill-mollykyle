THINK before you code...
1. Ask user for input for typePackage
2. Strip and set typePackage to lowercase
3. while the typePackage is either "green", "blue", or "purple":
    a. if typePackage = "green"
        i. providedGB = 2
        ii. additionalGBCost = 15
        iii. costPerMonth = 49.99
        iv. assign GBused to user input
        v. if GBused is greater than providedGB:
            1. calculate totalCost by adding costPerMonth and ((GBused - providedGB)(additionalGBCost))
            2. ask user if they have a coupon
            3. while coupon is true and cost is greater than or equal to 75:
                a. set value for coupon
                b. subtract coupon from cost
                c. return totalCost
        vii. output total cost
    b. otherwise if typePackage = "blue"
         i. providedGB = 4
         ii. additionalGBCost = 10
         iii. costPerMonth = 70
         iv. assign GBused to user input
         v. if GBused is greater than providedGB:
            1. calculate totalCost by adding costPerMonth and ((GBused - providedGB)(additionalGBCost))
         iv. else
            1. totalCost = costPerMonth
            2. output totalCost

    c. otherwise if typePackage = "purple":
          i. providedGB = 4
          ii. additionalGBCost = 10
          iii. costPerMonth = 70
          iv. ask for cost
    d. Output error message
    e. Ask for new typePackage?
